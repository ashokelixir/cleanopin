# Task 17 Implementation Summary

## Core AWS Infrastructure with Terraform - ✅ COMPLETED

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 17: "Implement core AWS infrastructure with Terraform"

### Requirements Implemented

All sub-tasks from Task 17 have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ Create VPC module with public and private subnets across multiple AZs
- ✅ Configure Internet Gateway, NAT Gateways, and route tables
- ✅ Set up security groups for application, database, and cache tiers
- ✅ Implement Network ACLs for additional security layer
- ✅ Create VPC endpoints for AWS services (S3, ECR, Secrets Manager)

### Infrastructure Components Implemented

#### 1. VPC Module (`terraform/modules/vpc/`)

**Core Networking:**
- Custom VPC with DNS support and hostnames enabled
- Multi-AZ subnet architecture:
  - Public subnets (3 AZs) - for load balancers and NAT gateways
  - Private subnets (3 AZs) - for application workloads
  - Database subnets (3 AZs) - for data tier isolation
- Internet Gateway for public internet access
- NAT Gateways (one per AZ) for secure outbound internet access
- Route tables with proper routing for each subnet tier

**Network ACLs (Defense in Depth):**
- **Public NACL**: Allows HTTP/HTTPS inbound, all outbound
- **Private NACL**: Allows VPC traffic and ephemeral ports for return traffic
- **Database NACL**: Restricts to database ports (5432, 6379) from VPC only

**VPC Endpoints (Private AWS Service Access):**
- **S3 Gateway Endpoint**: Cost-effective S3 access without internet routing
- **ECR Interface Endpoints**: Container image pulls (dkr and api)
- **Secrets Manager Endpoint**: Secure configuration retrieval
- **CloudWatch Logs Endpoint**: Log shipping without internet
- **CloudWatch Monitoring Endpoint**: Metrics collection

#### 2. Security Groups Module (`terraform/modules/security-groups/`)

**Application Tier Security Groups:**
- **ALB Security Group**: HTTP/HTTPS from internet
- **ECS Security Group**: Application port from ALB, outbound to databases
- **Bastion Security Group**: SSH from specified CIDR blocks

**Database Tier Security Groups:**
- **RDS Security Group**: PostgreSQL (5432) from ECS and bastion
- **Redis Security Group**: Redis (6379) from ECS and bastion

**Infrastructure Security Groups:**
- **VPC Endpoints Security Group**: HTTPS from VPC CIDR

**Security Features:**
- Least privilege access controls
- Circular dependency resolution using separate security group rules
- Lifecycle management with `create_before_destroy`
- Comprehensive tagging for resource management

```

### Security Implementation

#### Network Security (Defense in Depth)
1. **Security Groups**: Application-level firewall rules
2. **Network ACLs**: Subnet-level firewall rules
3. **Private Subnets**: Application and database tiers isolated from internet
4. **VPC Endpoints**: AWS service access without internet routing

#### Access Control
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions between tiers
- **Network Segmentation**: Separate subnets for each application tier
- **CIDR Restrictions**: SSH access limited to specified networks
- **Port-Specific Rules**: Only required ports open between tiers

### Environment Support

The infrastructure supports multiple environments with different configurations:

- **Development**: Single NAT Gateway, smaller instances
- **Staging**: Multi-AZ setup, production-like sizing
- **Production**: Full redundancy, optimized performance

### Validation Results

Both modules have been validated successfully:
- ✅ VPC Module: `terraform validate` - Success
- ✅ Security Groups Module: `terraform validate` - Success
- ✅ Terraform formatting: All files properly formatted

### Integration Points

The implemented infrastructure provides outputs for integration with future modules:

**VPC Outputs:**
- VPC ID and CIDR block
- Subnet IDs for all tiers
- Route table IDs
- NAT Gateway and Internet Gateway IDs
- Network ACL IDs
- VPC Endpoint IDs

**Security Group Outputs:**
- Security group IDs for all tiers
- Ready for use by RDS, ElastiCache, ECS, and ALB modules

### Next Steps

This core infrastructure is ready for the following future tasks:
- Task 18: Provision RDS PostgreSQL with Terraform
- Task 19: Set up ElastiCache Redis cluster with Terraform
- Task 20: Create SQS queues and messaging infrastructure with Terraform
- Task 21: Implement ECS Fargate infrastructure with Terraform

### Requirements Mapping

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the design document:

- **Requirement 11.4**: ECS deployment infrastructure foundation
- **Requirement 11.5**: Containerization and deployment infrastructure
- **Security**: Comprehensive network security implementation
- **Scalability**: Multi-AZ architecture for high availability
- **Cost Optimization**: Environment-specific resource sizing

### Compliance and Best Practices
