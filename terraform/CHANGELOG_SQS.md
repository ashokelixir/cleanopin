## Environment-Specific Configurations

### Development Environment
```hcl
# Lower thresholds and basic configuration
sqs_queue_depth_alarm_threshold = 50
sqs_message_age_alarm_threshold = 600  # 10 minutes
sqs_enable_high_throughput = false
```

### Staging Environment
```hcl
# Production-like settings for testing
sqs_queue_depth_alarm_threshold = 100
sqs_message_age_alarm_threshold = 300  # 5 minutes
sqs_enable_high_throughput = false
```

### Production Environment
```hcl
# High performance and strict monitoring
sqs_queue_depth_alarm_threshold = 200
sqs_message_age_alarm_threshold = 180  # 3 minutes
sqs_enable_high_throughput = true
sqs_deduplication_scope = "messageGroup"
sqs_fifo_throughput_limit = "perMessageGroupId"
```

## Security Enhancements

### IAM Permissions
- Least-privilege access for ECS tasks
- Account-level resource restrictions
- Support for batch operations
- Queue management capabilities

### Encryption
- Server-side encryption enabled by default
- AWS managed keys for cost efficiency
- Optional customer managed KMS keys
- In-transit encryption via HTTPS

### Network Security
- VPC-based deployment
- Security group integration
- Private subnet access
- VPC endpoint compatibility

## Monitoring and Observability

### CloudWatch Alarms
- **Queue Depth**: Monitors message backlog
- **Message Age**: Detects processing delays
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Immediate failure alerts

### Metrics Available
- Number of messages sent/received
- Queue depth over time
- Message processing latency
- Error rates and patterns

### Environment-Specific Thresholds
- Development: Relaxed thresholds for testing
- Staging: Production-like monitoring
- Production: Strict thresholds for reliability

## Cost Optimization Features

### Efficiency Measures
- Long polling enabled (20 seconds)
- Appropriate message retention periods
- Dead letter queues prevent infinite processing
- Environment-specific resource sizing

### Cost Monitoring
- CloudWatch billing integration
- Queue metrics for usage analysis
- Batch operations for reduced API calls
- Optimized polling intervals

## Migration and Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
1. Existing Terraform infrastructure deployed
2. AWS CLI configured with SQS permissions
3. Terraform >= 1.5 installed
4. Backend S3 bucket and DynamoDB table configured

### Deployment Steps
1. **Plan Changes**: Review SQS resources to be created
2. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Apply SQS module and IAM updates
3. **Test Configuration**: Run automated tests
4. **Update Application**: Configure queue URLs in application
5. **Monitor Deployment**: Verify CloudWatch alarms and metrics

### Rollback Plan
1. **Preserve Messages**: Ensure no critical messages in queues
2. **Update Application**: Remove SQS dependencies
3. **Destroy Resources**: Use destroy mode in deployment script
4. **Verify Cleanup**: Confirm all resources are removed

## Integration Points
