# Terraform Validation Fixes

This document outlines the issues found during Terraform validation and the fixes applied.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical Issues

#### ✅ Missing FIFO Queue Configuration in SQS Module
**Issue**: The SQS module defined variables for FIFO queue configuration (`deduplication_scope` and `fifo_throughput_limit`) but didn't use them in the resource definitions.

**Fix**: Added the missing FIFO configuration parameters to both main FIFO queues and FIFO DLQs:
```hcl
# FIFO specific settings
fifo_queue                  = true
content_based_deduplication = each.value.content_based_deduplication
deduplication_scope         = var.deduplication_scope
fifo_throughput_limit       = var.fifo_throughput_limit
```

**Impact**: This enables proper FIFO queue configuration for high-throughput scenarios in production.

#### ✅ Incomplete KMS Key Configuration
**Issue**: SQS queues were configured for encryption but didn't properly handle custom KMS keys.

**Fix**: Added proper KMS key configuration:
```hcl
# Enable server-side encryption
sqs_managed_sse_enabled = var.enable_sse && var.kms_key_id == null
kms_master_key_id       = var.kms_key_id
```

**Impact**: Allows for both AWS-managed and customer-managed KMS keys for encryption.

### 2. Security Issues

#### ✅ Hardcoded AWS Credentials
**Issue**: Staging and production tfvars files contained hardcoded AWS access keys and secret keys.

**Fix**: Removed hardcoded credentials and added comments to use IAM roles:
```hcl
aws_access_key  = "" # Use IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials
aws_secret_key  = "" # Use IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials
```

**Impact**: Eliminates security risk of credential exposure in version control.

**Recommendation**: Use IAM roles for service authentication instead of access keys.

### 3. Configuration Inconsistencies

#### ✅ PostgreSQL Version Inconsistency
**Issue**: Different PostgreSQL versions across environments:
- Dev: 15.13
- Staging: 15.4
- Prod: 15.4

**Fix**: Standardized all environments to use PostgreSQL 15.13 (latest patch version).

**Impact**: Ensures consistency across environments and includes latest security patches.

### 4. Code Quality

#### ✅ Terraform Formatting
**Issue**: Several Terraform files had formatting inconsistencies.

**Fix**: Applied `terraform fmt -recursive` to standardize formatting across all files.

**Impact**: Improves code readability and maintainability.

## Validation Tools Created

### 1. Terraform Validation Script
Created `scripts/validate-terraform.ps1` that performs:
- Terraform installation check
- Configuration formatting validation
- Terraform configuration validation
- Security issue detection
- Environment consistency checks

Usage:
```powershell
./scripts/validate-terraform.ps1 -Environment dev
```

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Security
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in configuration files
- ✅ Proper encryption configuration for all resources
- ✅ Environment-specific security settings

### 2. Consistency
- ✅ Standardized resource naming conventions
- ✅ Consistent versions across environments
- ✅ Uniform tagging strategy

### 3. Maintainability
- ✅ Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive variable validation
- ✅ Proper resource dependencies

### 4. Monitoring
- ✅ CloudWatch alarms for all critical resources
- ✅ Environment-specific alarm thresholds
- ✅ Comprehensive logging configuration

## Remaining Recommendations

### 1. Backend Configuration
Consider implementing remote state management:
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "cleanarch-template/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-south-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
```

### 2. Environment-Specific Workspaces
Use Terraform workspaces for environment isolation:
```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration
Integrate the validation script into your CI/CD pipeline:
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Validate Terraform
  run: ./terraform/scripts/validate-terraform.ps1 -Environment ${{ matrix.environment }}
```

### 4. State File Security
- Store state files in encrypted S3 buckets
- Use DynamoDB for state locking
- Implement proper IAM policies for state access

### 5. Secrets Management
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for all sensitive configuration
- Implement automatic secret rotation where possible
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys for service authentication

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Format Check**:
   ```bash
   terraform fmt -check -recursive
   ```

2. **Validation**:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

3. **Plan Generation**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
   ```

4. **Security Scan**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate-terraform.ps1 -Environment dev
   ```

## Conclusion

All critical issues have been resolved. The Terraform configuration now follows best practices for:
- Security (no hardcoded credentials, proper encryption)
- Consistency (standardized versions and configurations)
- Maintainability (modular structure, proper documentation)
- Monitoring (comprehensive CloudWatch integration)

The configuration is now ready for deployment across all environments.
