# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing a comprehensive permission management system with a permission matrix for the existing .NET 8 Clean Architecture Template. The system will provide fine-grained access control by defining specific permissions for different resources and actions, allowing administrators to create flexible role-based access control with granular permission assignments. This enhances the existing role system by adding a matrix-based approach to permission management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Permission Definition and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define and manage granular permissions for different resources and actions, so that I can control access to specific functionality within the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permissions are defined THEN the system SHALL support creating permissions with resource, action, and description
2. WHEN permissions are managed THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations for permission entities
3. WHEN permission hierarchies are needed THEN the system SHALL support parent-child permission relationships
4. WHEN permissions are validated THEN the system SHALL ensure unique combinations of resource and action
5. WHEN permissions are listed THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and searching capabilities by resource or action

### Requirement 2: Permission Matrix for Roles

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to assign multiple permissions to roles through a permission matrix interface, so that I can efficiently manage what each role can access and perform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN role permissions are assigned THEN the system SHALL support many-to-many relationships between roles and permissions
2. WHEN permission matrix is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a grid view of roles vs permissions with checkboxes
3. WHEN bulk permission assignment is performed THEN the system SHALL allow selecting multiple permissions for a role simultaneously
4. WHEN permission inheritance is configured THEN the system SHALL support role hierarchy with permission inheritance
5. WHEN permission conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution rules and validation

### Requirement 3: User-Specific Permission Overrides

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to grant or deny specific permissions to individual users regardless of their role assignments, so that I can handle exceptional access requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user-specific permissions are needed THEN the system SHALL support direct permission assignment to users
2. WHEN permission conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize user-specific permissions over role-based permissions
3. WHEN user permissions are managed THEN the system SHALL provide explicit grant and deny permission states
4. WHEN user access is evaluated THEN the system SHALL combine role permissions with user-specific overrides
5. WHEN audit trails are required THEN the system SHALL log all user-specific permission changes

### Requirement 4: Permission Evaluation and Authorization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust permission evaluation system that can quickly determine if a user has access to perform specific actions, so that I can secure API endpoints and business operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission checks are performed THEN the system SHALL evaluate user permissions in under 100ms
2. WHEN authorization is required THEN the system SHALL provide attribute-based authorization for controllers and actions
3. WHEN permission caching is implemented THEN the system SHALL cache user permissions with appropriate invalidation
4. WHEN permission evaluation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN bulk permission checks are needed THEN the system SHALL support checking multiple permissions in a single operation

### Requirement 5: Permission Management API

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want comprehensive REST API endpoints for permission management, so that I can build administrative interfaces for managing permissions and roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission APIs are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for all permission operations
2. WHEN role permission matrix is requested THEN the system SHALL return structured data showing role-permission relationships
3. WHEN permission assignments are updated THEN the system SHALL support batch operations for efficiency
4. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include proper pagination, filtering, and sorting
5. WHEN API security is enforced THEN the system SHALL require appropriate permissions to access permission management endpoints

### Requirement 6: Permission Audit and Reporting

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want detailed audit trails and reporting for all permission-related activities, so that I can ensure proper access control governance and meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission changes occur THEN the system SHALL log all permission assignments, removals, and modifications
2. WHEN audit reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide reports showing user permissions and access patterns
3. WHEN compliance checks are performed THEN the system SHALL identify users with excessive or unusual permission combinations
4. WHEN historical data is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain permission change history with timestamps and actors
5. WHEN access reviews are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide exportable reports in common formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)

### Requirement 7: Permission Seeding and Default Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want predefined permission sets and default role configurations, so that I can quickly set up the system with standard access patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN the system SHALL create default permissions for common resources and actions
2. WHEN standard roles are needed THEN the system SHALL provide predefined roles with appropriate permission sets
3. WHEN permission seeding is performed THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific permission configurations
4. WHEN system updates occur THEN the system SHALL automatically add new permissions without affecting existing assignments
5. WHEN permission cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL identify and handle orphaned or unused permissions

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the permission system to perform efficiently at scale, so that authorization checks don't become a bottleneck as the system grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission data is accessed THEN the system SHALL implement efficient database indexing for permission queries
2. WHEN caching is utilized THEN the system SHALL cache permission data with Redis for distributed scenarios
3. WHEN permission checks are frequent THEN the system SHALL optimize for read-heavy workloads with minimal write impact
4. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms response times for permission evaluation
5. WHEN cache invalidation occurs THEN the system SHALL efficiently update cached permission data across all instances
